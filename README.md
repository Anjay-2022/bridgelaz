Design Pattern Programs
Creational Design Patterns
Refer SIngleton Link and practice the various SIngleton Approaches that are possible. This includes 
Eager initialization
Static block initialization
Lazy Initialization
Thread Safe Singleton
Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation
Using Reflection to destroy Singleton Pattern
Enum Singleton
Serialization and Singleton
Use Factory Pattern to create a Computer Factory that can Produce PC, Laptop and Server Class Computers. As Shown in the Figure Below Create an Abstract Computer Class and PC, Laptop and Server inherit from Computer and ComputerFactory is able to create the corresponding Computer Object on request


Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing. Use Prototype Pattern as shown in the Link above to create multiple Employee Object
Structural Design Patterns
Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and its used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object that joins these unrelated interface is called an Adapter. Use Adapter design pattern to solve mobile charger which adapts to a Mobile battery needs 3 volts to charge but the normal socket produces either 120V (US) or 240V (India). So the mobile charger works as an adapter between mobile charging socket and the wall socket.

Facade design pattern is used to help client applications to easily interact with the system. In the Address Book Problem use Facade Pattern to read the Address Book from the File or from the Database

Proxy design pattern as the name suggests creates a Proxy Object to a real Object so as to provide controlled access to a functionality. Create a Command Executor Program that will execute certain system commands based on the user type is admin or otherwise. The Proxy design pattern link shows the same example.
Behavioral Design Patterns
Observer design pattern is useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change. In observer pattern, the object that watch on the state of another object are called Observer and the object that is being watched is called Subject. 
For observer pattern java program example, implement a simple topic and observers can register to this topic. Whenever any new message will be posted to the topic, all the registers observers will be notified and they can consume the message.


Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects. With the help of visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class.
For example, think of a Shopping cart where we can add different type of items (Elements). When we click on checkout button, it calculates the total amount to be paid. Now we can have the calculation logic in item classes or we can move out this logic to another class using visitor pattern. Let’s implement this in our example of visitor pattern.

Mediator Design Pattern is very helpful in an enterprise application where multiple objects are interacting with each other. If the objects interact with each other directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with each other that makes higher maintainability cost and not hard to extend. Mediator pattern focuses on provide a mediator between objects for communication and help in implementing loose-coupling between objects.
Allows loose coupling by encapsulating the way disparate sets of objects interact and communicate with each other.
